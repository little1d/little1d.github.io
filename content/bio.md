Hi, I'm Yang Zhuo. I am currently an undergraduate student at the School of Artificial Intelligence, Xidian University (2022-2026). Starting in 2026, I will join the School of Computer Science and Engineering, [Southeast University](https://cse.seu.edu.cn/) (supervised by Associate Professor [Beilun Wang](https://cs.seu.edu.cn/beilun/main.htm)) and the [Shanghai Innovation Institute](https://www.sii.edu.cn/) as an incoming Ph.D. student.

Currently, I am a research intern at the AI for Science Center, Shanghai AI Laboratory, supervised by Associate Professor [Tianfan Fu](https://futianfan.github.io/) and [Yuqiang Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=RQqws5gAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate).

My research interests primarily lie in AI for Spectroscopy, Protein Design, and drug design. Although I am still exploring these fields, I am always eager to learn and connect with others. If you are interested in my work or just want to chat, feel free to reach out!
